# GtLab CI auto-deployment example

Here is devOps files for application with Vue.js frontend and Ruby on Rails API. It assumes frontend to be placed in frontend/ directory, and Rails API to be in a project root.

It will automatically deploy pushes to the master branch on main port, and pushes to the dev branch on one of the additional ports in order to always have working backup-application. It also can be a default production-staging schema.

This is just example files, not for direct use.
